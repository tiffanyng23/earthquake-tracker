[Earthquake Tracker](https://earthquake-tracker-8ee50507f0d6.herokuapp.com/)

I created a global earthquake tracker using Plotly Dash that uses an earthquake api from the [United States Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/). This tracker provides real-time updates on total earthquakes from the past 30 days, 7 days, day, and hour. It also has visualizations to depict the location and magnitude of these earthquakes during these time periods.
